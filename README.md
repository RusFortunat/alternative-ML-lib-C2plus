# alternative-ML-lib-C2plus
Here we will try creating our own C++ library for our Machine Learning research. Specifically, we will introduce a new type of data structure that we will be calling Tensors as in PyTorch, and write a few methods for it.

Open tasks:

1. The network constructor method
2. Forward propagation method
3. Computation of the loss method
4. The backpropagation method


Once the class and its methods are written:

1. Test the data structure and its methods for regression tasks
2. Test the data structure and its methods for classification tasks
3. Test the data structure and its methods for "gymnasium" Reinforcement Learning tasks
