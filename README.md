# alternative-ML-lib-C2plus
Here we will try writing our own C++ library for for our ML research. Following PyTorch example, we will introduce our own Tensor class, and implement the basic methods for it, such as forwardprop, backprop, and loss computation. Then we will test our class for typical tasks, such as regularization and classification

Open tasks:

1. The network constructor method
2. Forward propagation method
3. Computation of the loss method
4. The backpropagation method
